Structural SVM
    - SVM for structure prediction
    - F(y_i,x_i) - F(y',x_i) is the BEST SCORE - score we're considering which is y'
    - slack variable exists b/c hamming variable not continuous, so cannot directly minimize
    - continuous surrogate of hamming loss

For epsilon shit (24)
if sequence varies wildy in length, may want to use normalized hamming length (otherwise long sequences will dominate)

for every training point, we find the y' whose constraint is most violated (step 2 loops over every training example)

generalization depends on number of support vectors and epsilon
